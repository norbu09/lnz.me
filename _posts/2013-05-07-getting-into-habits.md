Habits structure your life. Knowing your habits and training new habits
can be real challenging and a lot of books have been written about how
to get into habits that help you achieve your goals. Thing is, like most
new year resolutions, it is real hard to stick to a habit and make it
stick around.

I have recently started playing [HabitRPG] and
challenged my partner to join me. We now battle us for points to things
like drinking enough water during the day or go running. HabitRPG is an
amazing little game that helps you gamify your habits and todos in a
really engaging way and helps you stay on top of your habits ... or you
run out of health points and die.

For those that are commandline affictionados there is a commandline
interface to HabitRPG that helps greatly in automating task completions
and tying it into a daily workflow.
