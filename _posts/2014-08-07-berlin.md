Since a while we live in Berlin for a change. It is really interesting
to see how much New Zealand changed me and to see how different things
look to me now, that I have distance to them.

The most obvious thing to me is that there is this interesting split
between expats that are here to enjoy living in the startup capital of
Europe and the Germans that always find something that is bothering
them, something they can complain about, something that someone needs to
change. The observation for me is that Germans in Germany are happy to
make some else responsible for their current situation whereas those who
come here just try to get stuff done.

This may be a bigger thought and because of the comparably young age of
New Zealand most Kiwis needed to get stuff done, complaining did not get
you anywhere. Obviously there are awesome people here in Germany that
get stuff done, don't blame any higher instance for their current
situation and there are Kiwis that complain bitterly about things, it is
more the general mood, the general way of how the majority thinks and
represents itself to me.

So, summer is awesome and there are plenty of positive people around me,
just most of them speak English ... like me.
