                    <p>I did a lot of thinking about ways how we could build a more humane and
inclusive startup scene in New Zealand but the recent events in the US
made me think a little bigger. These ideas are very much a &ldquo;thinking in
progress&rdquo; so please give me feedback on them so we can push this idea
forward. This is where I am at:</p>

<p>Looking at what we currently call digital nomads and the emergence of
remote first companies, how relevant are location, political systems and
financial hubs in a post Silicon Valley startup scene?</p>

<p>I would like to postulate a very provocative &ldquo;not at all&rdquo;. Looking at
iwantmyname, we have people in New Zealand, USA, Canada, Sweden, Austria
and Germany at the moment, Over the years we have been approached by
investors from many countries, some from the obvious financial centers but
also from places that I would call &ldquo;emerging markets&rdquo;. We hire by talent
not by location and I travel a lot and work from various places, so do
many in our company. Location became one of the many parameters
describing my current situation but it is not a defining one and
certainly not constant.</p>

<p>Looking at the current startup scene through the lens of a startup
mentor I would suggest to someone creating a new scene to disrupt the
established system with fresh ideas that fit this new reality. If we
take Silicon Valley as the old incumbent and push for a new niche, a
truly distributed but well connected startup scene that is based on a
solid foundation of core values rather than an investment model seems
like a good niche to start with. I would be keen to try something like
that and would back a new, post Silicon Valley startup scene like that
with my time and experience and networks.</p>

<p>An antifragile startup scene that can&rsquo;t be disrupted by changing
political systems because we can simply switch to new countries, work
out of new co-working spaces, join new physical communities, learn
from them, then take that learning with us to the next and the next
place. A scene that does not need temples for the egos of the founders in
the form of massive office buildings but rather lets people work from
where they want because the output matters, not their attendance. If we
take all this and pour it into a founding fabric of values, would that
be a scene you want to be associated with?</p>

<p>Ping me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/norbu09">@norbu09</a> if you want
to discuss this in more detail or have ideas how we can push these ideas
further into the mainstream. Please point me to people thinking along
the same lines, show me the existing networks already doing this without
me knowing.</p>
