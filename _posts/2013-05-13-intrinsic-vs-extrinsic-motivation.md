description: intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation
---

I have mentored at Startup Weekend Auckland last weekend and noticed an
interesting pattern. Participants that were at the weekend with the goal
to win the competition were less motivated in the teams they were in if
they thought the team is not doing well. Participants that were at the
weekend primarily to learn something and did not care too much about
winning were highly motivated and performed really well. Teams
consisting exclusively out of participants who wanted to learn were very
receptive to external input and managed to deliver a very good product.
The winning team was formed by participants that wanted to learn, they
were very motivated and executed very well as a team.

So, how come trying to win is in the way of winning? 

It comes down to intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation. If your motivation
is trying to achieve something real bad and your task involves
non-trivial problems, or highly creative tasks then any focus on the
goal slows you down. If the task is a highly repetitive task then
extrinsic motivation works very well. I had seen this before and
remembered the candle problem outlined here: [Wikipedia: The candle problem]

Intrinsic motivation should always be the one that you push in your
startup. Trying to motivate you and your team by extrinsic motivators
will hinder your performance as a team and will be in your way to make
best use of your creativity. Always look for a way to push intrinsic
motivators and your productivity and creativity will rise.
