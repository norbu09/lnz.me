testing buzz ...
================

as buzz is only available via my iPhone so far i tried to figure out
from the API docs and the mailinglist how to make it all work. i hope i
have all the right headers in place and google actually knows that this
blog belongs to my shiny [google profile][1] and all.

if all goes well this post will trigger a new entry in my buzz ....
whatever. we will see in ... hours/days/weeks ... who cares anyway :-)
