When we started [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com) 10 years ago we sat down
and defined an impact statement first. It is still up on [our about page under
the “domain ethics” heading.](https://iwantmyname.com/about)

We launched into an industry that was focussed on the customer in a value
extracting mode, monetizing every aspect of a customer as effectively as
possible. We added a product that had a _value adding mindset_ to that industry,
we did not see competition but an opportunity to help customers be more
effective.

We started with an impact statement and optimized for impact rather than
shareholder value or market share. This fundamental difference in focus made it
possible to set us apart from the rest of the industry and made us successful
enough to build a sustainable business.

We could have stopped there but we were interested in the long term impact and
looking back we did have a significant impact on our industry. As an industry
we moved towards a more customer centric view and help customers achieve their
goals rather than just clip the ticket and hold more tickets in front of them.

With our impact view we also defined the startup community in New Zealand as
one of our focus points and helped shape a very successful community here.
Further to that we picked other impact areas like clean water in Bali and
decided to set aside a part of every domain registration for those secondary
impact goals.

After 10 years of focussing on adding value we made it to a point where not
only our industry is aware of what we do and follows but also our customers
have gained as the industry shifts. I have thought a lot about abundance
mentality recently and looking back am happy to report that it actually works.
