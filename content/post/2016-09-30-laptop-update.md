Back in July I wrote about going back to FreeBSD and I wanted to give a quick
update on that. To sum it up, it was so painless it nearly does not warrant a
blog post. I tinkered around a bit with 10.3-RELEASE and 11-CURRENT before
stumbling over [TrueOS](https://www.trueos.org/) the new name for PCBSD, gave
it a try and never looked back. Initially I had some trouble with my display
driver and just used the framebuffer one to have something working but TrueOS
found all hardware instantly and just made it work.

Things that work out of the box on the X1 Carbon that surprised me:
- plugging in an external projector, notoriously painful, just works
- sound
- trackpad, incl scrolling how I am used to on a mac

Things I needed to fix:
- media keys for volume
- resume

So far I am super happy, still need to figure out a nicer way to run the update
process from i3 as I got really used to that and seem to struggle a bit with
Lumina but happy enough to just fire up that every now and then and update from
there.

The suspend works nicely but resume messes up my graphics but surprisingly I
got used to shutting down my laptop and have a few interesting side effects,
like starting with a clean slate every morning.

Very happy that I made the switch back to FreeBSD and nothing that could make
me switch back any time soon.
