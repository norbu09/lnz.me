*TL;DR: Thursday, 14th January 2016, 5:30 at Bridge Street*

I am passionate about community and passionate about empowering people
to realise their ideas, as opposed to just talking about them. I am also
keen to bring together people so that they can help each other.

New year, new challenge. My personal challenge for this year is to build
a robust and well connected entrepreneurial fabric in Nelson and create
a blueprint for regions outside the major centers. There is loads of
entrepreneurial spirit in the regions but it is not well connected yet
and typically gets together once a year for events like Startup Weekend
but not much more.

[founder.chat](http://founder.chat) is a weekly meetup that happens at
Bridge Street on Thursdays at 5:30. It is open to everyone, no signup
required, just come around, no fee, no koha, no barriers to entry other
than you making time to show up. We'll do a quick round of intros every
time and then work together on a few problems within the group. This
could be setting up a social media campaign, set up a landing page, look
into A/B testing or get help with book keeping or a legal problem.

Over time I hope we can grow that fabric that whenever someone needs
help they know who to talk to, in person, face-to-face. Community is
what remains after the politicians, the investors and the people with an
agenda left. My goal is to grow a fabric that is robust and long lived
so that we can make sure it lives on for a long time. An open community
is also something no one owns. It needs a few people to kick it off but
once it lives there is no stopping it. Help me to get it started and
help me to transform the Nelson region.

We are starting the new year with the first meetup this Thursday, 14th
of January 2016 at 5:30 at Bridge Street. Come around, tell us what you
are working on or what you plan to work on and what you need help with.
After a bit of helping each other we'll go to a nearby Pub and have a
social wind down with a cool beverage.
