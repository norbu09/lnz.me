      <description>I have helped build and contribute to the NZ startup community since around 2008 and during that time have been granted access to many groups, back channels, side channels, communication channels that I signed up to or got signed up to and it continues, every new group that forms starts creating yet another mailing list and slack channel and Facebook group.
Over the years we have created this monster that looks very open and approachable from the inside but gives no clues on how to join it from the outside.</description>

      <description>UPDATES BELOW
For most of my adult life I was to some degree involved in internet infrastructure and the open source community. These two communities are special in one very fundamental trait, they only work if people collaborate. I did not realise that this was such a special thing till I encountered other communities that were much more elitist and harder to approach and did not understand what made them different till way later in my life.</description>

      <description>Intentions for people to engage in any community are as diverse as the people that engage. Many intentions means many desired outcomes and that means that tensions may arise from simply trying to &amp;ldquo;do the right thing&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;the right thing&amp;rdquo; has never been articulated.
I have been part of many projects, communities, companies and teams that ran into exactly this problem, &amp;ldquo;why am I here and what do I want to get out of it&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>How could a post Silicon Valley startup scene look like</title>

      <description>I did a lot of thinking about ways how we could build a more humane and inclusive startup scene in New Zealand but the recent events in the US made me think a little bigger. These ideas are very much a &amp;ldquo;thinking in progress&amp;rdquo; so please give me feedback on them so we can push this idea forward. This is where I am at:
Looking at what we currently call digital nomads and the emergence of remote first companies, how relevant are location, political systems and financial hubs in a post Silicon Valley startup scene?</description>

      <description>Last weekend I co-facilitated Startup Weekend Taranaki with Pascale, a team that in my view works very well: two funny accents, two funny last names, two very different backgrounds so we cover a large amount of ground to help deliver a relevant event.
Over the years both of us have been deeply involved in other experimental events, like Mashup and startup.school.nz where we explore ways of introducing entrepreneurship in other ways than the Startup Weekend format.</description>

      <description>Back in July I wrote about going back to FreeBSD and I wanted to give a quick update on that. To sum it up, it was so painless it nearly does not warrant a blog post. I tinkered around a bit with 10.3-RELEASE and 11-CURRENT before stumbling over TrueOS the new name for PCBSD, gave it a try and never looked back. Initially I had some trouble with my display driver and just used the framebuffer one to have something working but TrueOS found all hardware instantly and just made it work.</description>

      <description>My first FreeBSD version was 2.2.8, for context, that was in the late 90s. I started running FreeBSD on my desktops back then, and even managed to get it onto a few laptops. I also build servers and firewalls and I loved the OS but eventually caved in and switched to a Mac (a shiny 12&amp;rdquo; MacBook) around the FreeBSD 5 days (that would have been the mid 2000s)
From really enjoying shiny GUI tools and working Wifi without patching my kernel, did I mention suspend/resume?</description>

      <description>TL;DR: Thursday, 14th January 2016, 5:30 at Bridge Street
I am passionate about community and passionate about empowering people to realise their ideas, as opposed to just talking about them. I am also keen to bring together people so that they can help each other.
New year, new challenge. My personal challenge for this year is to build a robust and well connected entrepreneurial fabric in Nelson and create a blueprint for regions outside the major centers.</description>

      <title>Global Entrepreneurship Week</title>

      <description>I care about entrepreneurship because I believe in the power of collaboration and the power of people working together for fun and profit, quite literally. I see entrepreneurship as a way to create resilient communities that address problems by working together, by building companies, by creating work for others and by investing back into the community. Entrepreneurs are people that have a vision and are crazy enough to follow that vision, passionate enough to infect others with their idea and make them form a team around a common interest.</description>

      <description>When I think about building software I try to see where we need to end up in order to help the customer right now and then work backwards from there. Because I am really bad at knowing what customers want I mock up something that is good enough to get feedback and then morph it into working code and then robust infrastructure. At iwantmyname I have pushed for this since we started and for the most part we succeeded till we tried to grow up and &amp;ldquo;clean up&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;do things properly&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>The developers dilemma</title>
      <link>http://lnz.me/2015/07/07/the-developers-dilemma/</link>

      <guid>http://lnz.me/2015/07/07/the-developers-dilemma/</guid>
      <description>Writing software is an interesting process. It transforms abstract concepts, feature requests, vague ideas into something people can interact with. It is a modern way of making ideas real, tangible, visible and hopefully usable. This process is a strange mixture of operating within tight constraints and at the same time being highly creative.
Developers come in many flavours, just like traditional crafts men, they may have studied for many years or just picked up an editor and started mucking around in someone else&amp;rsquo;s code till they felt comfortable enough to write their own code.</description>

      <description>Last week I attended an interesting conference called open source//open society that brought together an interesting cross section of geekdom that I have not seen at a conference before. I had discussions ranging from editor flame wars via &amp;ldquo;the open source model&amp;rdquo; to tiny houses and earthships. The most interesting in my view was the high diversity of skills in the room that made for extremely interesting discussions.
It also helped me spell out and phrase what for me open source really means and what the essence of the open source movement is in my view so I wanted to share it and write it down for future reference.</description>

      <description>We are starting a new experiment in our life, it is called &amp;ldquo;project mountain retreat&amp;rdquo;. The back story to this experiment is that Manu, ever since we first were in St Arnaud and looked at Lake Rotoiti, loved this place and it felt very much at home for me right away. It took us years to come back to this place but now we plan to stay a bit longer.</description>

Juha Saarinen posted this article on the Herald and it is really not helping to turn around and say &amp;ldquo;we told you so&amp;rdquo;, what we actually need is politicians to get off their arrogant attitude and actually listen to the tech community.</description>

      <description>I read Derek Sivers post Getting out of a bad place today and it made me clean up my blog, re-launch it, collect a few old posts I had scattered around and release a post that I, myself, had only shared privately so far. It is about my history with work-till-you-drop and my history with a mind that is driven to continue well past the point where it is productive or healthy.</description>

      <description>I attended a 4 hour work week meetup in Berlin yesterday and noticed one big difference between me and many that were there. Tim Ferris, the author or 4 hour work week, starts from the point of view that work is something that is not fun and in order to &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; you need to work as little as possible so you can enjoy your life.
Now, this is where I would argue that I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked in a long time as everything I do are things I actually enjoy doing.</description>

      <description>Since a while we live in Berlin for a change. It is really interesting to see how much New Zealand changed me and to see how different things look to me now, that I have distance to them.
The most obvious thing to me is that there is this interesting split between expats that are here to enjoy living in the startup capital of Europe and the Germans that always find something that is bothering them, something they can complain about, something that someone needs to change.</description>

      <description>There are two Startup Weekends coming up in Hawkes Bay and Taurange. Startup Weekends are a perfect opportunity to learn how to transform an idea to a MVP, a minimal viable product. Startup Weekends are a crash course in entrepreneurschip over a weekend in a sheltered environment and with near to no financial implications. The costs, in fact, are often not even covering the food and drinks provided during the weekend.</description>

      <description>When starting a company there is a lot of stuff that needs to be looked at. There are lots of things that need your attention and many things will not be talked about because there is simply no time for it. This can very easily lead to a habit of not communicating with everyone in the team. Another frequent problem is that from your own point of view a lot of things are very obvious and you just can&amp;rsquo;t understand how someone in your team can&amp;rsquo;t see it.</description>

      <description>A key task for any co-founder is getting advice. Especially if you are new to something it is key to ask. It is important to understand that others have more experience in things that you will bang your head against. Getting advice is key to a successful start and helps you keep on track, helps you grow and helps you reposition yourself. Advice is a key ingredient for many of the most successful entrepreneurs and not getting advice is a silly thing to do.</description>

      <description>Leadership is a tricky thing and over the years I have tried different styles and was exposed to different styles. I have observed many every successful people and people in high positions that lead big companies.
I found that most leaders fall into two categories. Leader by example and leader by position. What I mean with that is people that live and breath what they demand from their team, people that are respected for what they know and people that don&amp;rsquo;t have to hide behind a title to be accepted.</description>

      <description>I have mentored at Startup Weekend Auckland last weekend and noticed an interesting pattern. Participants that were at the weekend with the goal to win the competition were less motivated in the teams they were in if they thought the team is not doing well. Participants that were at the weekend primarily to learn something and did not care too much about winning were highly motivated and performed really well. Teams consisting exclusively out of participants who wanted to learn were very receptive to external input and managed to deliver a very good product.</description>

      <description>I get quite a few people that ask me for advice on technical co-founders or how to find a technical person for their startup. The one sentence that ends a conversation with me needing to urgently attend another meeting or some other way of getting away in a polite way is the following:
&amp;ldquo;I know how to do idea X; I only need a technical person to build it for me.</description>

      <description>Habits structure your life. Knowing your habits and training new habits can be real challenging and a lot of books have been written about how to get into habits that help you achieve your goals. Thing is, like most new year resolutions, it is real hard to stick to a habit and make it stick around.
I have recently started playing HabitRPG and challenged my partner to join me. We now battle us for points to things like drinking enough water during the day or go running.</description>

      <title>Where to start?</title>

      <guid>http://lnz.me/2013/04/25/where-to-start/</guid>
      <description>I often get asked what non-technical co-founders should start with till they have found a technical co-founder. Mostly followed by, &amp;ldquo;where can I find a technical co-founder&amp;rdquo;.
This is an interesting topic as quite often I see the non-technical co-founders seeing their role in telling a tech guy what to do who then magically turns it into working code. Unfortunately this is not quite how it works and as a non-technical co-founder joining a startup without any understanding what it means to write software and to build a startup will most probably end in tears.</description>

      <description>SSH tunnel script(2) I work quite a bit with daemons on remote hosts that are normally not directly listening to the public internet. I use SSH tunnels a lot and had previously used a simplistic script to deal with it.
I got tired of having to reconnect SSH tunnels when I changed environments and wanted autossh to handle the connections. I hacked around a bit with a shell script and then came up with his perl version.</description>

      <description>lean prototyping stack For my new startup I play with a lean prototyping stack that will enable me to prototype and evaluate ideas really fast and test on the market. The idea is to bump out a new idea, prove it and if it works scale it further. In order to not having to rewrite the entire app once it is clear that the idea is worth pushing I tried to come up with a nice stack that enables me to prototype fast and scale if I have to.</description>

      <description>customer uses proposal as spec One of the joys of working as a contractor is quoting for projects that possibly become a real project some when. The joys of a contractor quoting to a larger company (at least by New Zealand standards) is that the decision trees are so arbitrary and long that it might take ages to get one of those projects. In the meantime you hang in limbo - not too sure if you should take on another project or not as that bigger one could still come.</description>

      <description>Three new destination markets in some months It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit of a busy time lately as we launched three new platforms in the last time and that brought with it a lot of challenges. Fortunately it also pushed me to complete our migration to our new backend which is now entirely message driven and based only on the finest stuff one finds in the moment.
The backend engine is RabbitMQ based and persists messages to CouchDB if necessary.</description>

      <description>Django like URL mapping in Catalyst - kind of
The problem I tried to solve is trivial, at least that was what I thought. I tried to remap URLs in one of our platforms to make it easy for others to adapt the way we call things. I18N related mostly. I have most of the things that might change in central config file already but figuring out how I actually get the URL map in there took a while.</description>

      <description>Simple ssh tunnel script When replicating CouchDB you need either VPN oder authentication or simply a SSH tunnel. No big deal normally a simple ssh -L... does the trick but I ended up with those SSH sessions that blocked ports and hung around and it was not the way to go in terms of automating rollouts where you need that port once and then never again.
A bit of googling brought up a script of the bacula guys that had the same problem and I adopted their script a bit to fit my needs.</description>

      <description>Startup automation - Part 3 git via HTTP with nginx Just in case you don&amp;rsquo;t know (very unlikely) or never played with nginx before. This is the web server and frontend HTTP loadbalancer all your HTTP based setups should have anyway. There is documentation in English on the nginx wiki (http://wiki.nginx.org) and if you get stuck there is a lot of stuff just on google. The rails community love nginx and they tend to document well - a thanks at this point to those guys.</description>

Obviously we need some test clients and a working server now to play. I use parallels for local development and normally fire up one VM per project. I created an empty debian VM and just did a apt-get install puppet.</description>

      <description>Startup automation - Part 1 Startup automation became a big buzz currently but I think it has always been key to those who were successful. The speed to market is important and this is not only true for small companies.
Enough marketing blurb. Truth is we tech guys are lazy and that is a good habit. Laziness keeps us creative in terms of minimising tasks we have to do and that means in automating stuff.</description>
