A key task for any co-founder is getting advice. Especially if you are
new to something it is key to ask. It is important to understand that
others have more experience in things that you will bang your head
against. Getting advice is key to a successful start and helps you keep
on track, helps you grow and helps you reposition yourself. Advice is a
key ingredient for many of the most successful entrepreneurs and not
getting advice is a silly thing to do.

So how does one get advice? A lot of young entrepreneurs mistake advice
with a "how-to". Trust me, there is no how-to on being successful, there
are way too many factors that come into play and if there would be a
how-to we would drown in a flood of successful startups and would need
another word for it.

I grew up next to a buddhist monastery and many of my fundamental world
views are based on buddhist principles like do no evil, live an
altruistic life and live what you teach. One very fundamental principle
that always stood out for me is that a student teacher relationship is
something that needs to be re-evaluated, constantly. A student should
always ask himself if the teacher is right, if the topic is relevant to
the student and if the teacher is going into the right direction from
the students point of view.

Taking this principle and applying it to getting advice lead me to
always trying to get to the essence someone advises me on. I try to get
the core principle, the core idea and then evaluate how it fits into my
world view, into my bigger picture. Reevaluating advice and having a
clear idea of your core values and your core idea helps you applying
advice and still staying true to your values. Advice used as a how-to,
blindly followed and executing upon without understanding the underlying
learnings can derail perfectly good ideas and teams. Not because the one
giving advice wants to harm you but because blindly following a recipe
is rarely giving you the insights that you need to apply the recipe in
the right way.

Always try to understand what the key learning is and how to apply it to
your startup. Advice comes from people, often successful, from their
point of view and from their point of view in their companies. It may be
highly relevant but it is always from their angle, be aware of it and
know how to evaluate its usefulness to your startup.
