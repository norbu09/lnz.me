            <h1>startup punk</h1>
            <p>
            I am a startup punk that sais "no" to any established norms.
            I love challenging people to overcome their traditional
            assumptions of how things are done. Whenever I speak to
            startups that hit a wall they normally leave the coffee
            table with a grin on their face and a new direction of how
            they could go forward by breaking out of their mental
            constraints. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I am a punk, I will chellange your assumptions!

            As a regular mentor at Startup Weekends I see many very
            early stage ideas clashing with teams that basrly know
            each other. This mainly social experiment gives me much
            insight into how teams form, which teams perform well
            and how decision making processes impact on
