            <h1>bio</h1>
            <p>
            Lenz is building internet architecture and maintains
            internet based systems since before the first .com bubble in
            the late 90s. He started his first own business age 19 and
            was a team lead in a mid-size consulting company in Germany
            age 21. He was CTO of one of the fastest growing domain
            registrars in Europe and, after the acquisition of said
            company by Lycos acted as the Technical Director for Domain
            Business with a direct team of 15 and a total volume of 1
            million domains under management. He currently runs a number
            of startups in New Zealand, the most prominent is
            iWantMyName with a predominantly US customer base and a very
            good reputation amongst early adopters and tech savvy users.
            Lenz has extensive experience in building small systems that
            can scale massively once they have to. His many years of
            experience in scaling large internet based systems and his
            experience of building small startups give him the far sight
            to use the right tools and build the right technology on
            constrained budgets.
