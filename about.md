I am a _co-founder of iwantmyname_ and _founder of springtimesoft_, a _mentor_
for early stage startups and a _regular at Startup Weekends_, a _startup
punk_ that will challenge all your established assumptions about
companies. I'm a _coder_, a _hacker_ and a _good friend_ to those who know me.

## Bio

Lenz is founder of Springtimesoft Consulting, a Wellington New Zealand
based consulting agency and co-founder of iwantmyname, a global player
in the domain name industry. Prior to moving to New Zealand Lenz was
part of fast growing startups in Germany and did his fair share in
corporate IT management.

Lenz has been managing teams for most of his adult life and is known to
run highly effective and motivated teams that deliver exceptional
results without compromises in happiness. Lenz is a mentor for startups
at any stage of development and helps drive many industry activities
that help grow a better startup community in New Zealand and world wide.
Pay him coffee/beer and he will happily give you feedback on your
current project or open up his network to find the person you need.
