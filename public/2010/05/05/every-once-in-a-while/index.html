<h1 id="real-geeks-die-early">real geeks die early</h1>

<p>every once in a while i <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2010/02/did-your-boss-thank-you-for-coding-yourself-to-death/">stumble upon an article</a> from someone pointing
out the dangers we geeks live in in terms of unhealthy work hours
and our very own unhealthy mind set.</p>

<p>I am a developer for profit since the late 90s and a team lead since the
early 2000s. i&rsquo;ve seen a fair amount of problems and have done my
fair share of work during nights, weekends and my holidays. it was
expected as part of my work and i was immature enough to not turn it
down.</p>

<p>when i look down the road i came from i&rsquo;ve lost a very good friend due
to depressions which were mainly coming from a very unhealthy work
environment and some more not so close friends either to heart attacks
or they suffered serious burn out syndromes that changed their ability
to work entirely. only weeks ago a friend of mine died after a heart
attack and he was only my age. our industry is seriously in trouble, we
set the wrong incentives and we abuse our developers as if we were in
the industrial revolution in the late 1900s.</p>

<p>the problem is that managers will never understand that programming is
not like building a car, you take some parts and can roughly estimate
when it is assembled. geeks invent cars (to stick with the
analogy) and inventing things is not as predictable as simply assembling
stuff. as much as we think we can judge things we are either way above
or way beyond the real time spent. as we normally love what we are doing
we take this risk and try to finish in time even if we are way off with
what we estimated. the problem with inventing is that it can always go
either way, we find that very simple solution simply like that or we
can&rsquo;t see it till months after the deadline. a manager has to deliver in
time - which is bollocks, it is never so time critical anyway - but a
developer has to invent that thing and deliver in time. once you are
behind schedule there is the pressure and the coding and normally this
is when quality suffers the most and the most unhealthy time is spent.
the manager keeps pushing you but he will not stay up till 2am sitting
next to you and help you code that beast. he is the one that sits
between you and the customer and has to fight off trouble - but he is
doing that between 9am and 5pm. i am not saying that either one of the
two is doing a more valuable job (i was on either side), i only want to
stress that healthy working times are essential and neglecting social
interaction which comes from long working hours will kill you.</p>

<p>it either kills you very directly with heart attacks or slightly less
deadly but still killing your career with burn outs and nervous
breakdowns or it kills you more indirect with depressions that can lead
to suicide.</p>

<p>i changed my personal rat race some years ago with killing my career and
deciding that life is more about living than piling up status symbols.
funny enough since then so many new opportunities arose that i am way
better off today than i was then. working only healthy hours is
essential for your life and social interaction is key to survive as a
developer!</p>
