      <description>Back in July I wrote about going back to FreeBSD and I wanted to give a quick update on that. To sum it up, it was so painless it nearly does not warrant a blog post. I tinkered around a bit with 10.3-RELEASE and 11-CURRENT before stumbling over TrueOS the new name for PCBSD, gave it a try and never looked back. Initially I had some trouble with my display driver and just used the framebuffer one to have something working but TrueOS found all hardware instantly and just made it work.</description>

      <description>My first FreeBSD version was 2.2.8, for context, that was in the late 90s. I started running FreeBSD on my desktops back then, and even managed to get it onto a few laptops. I also build servers and firewalls and I loved the OS but eventually caved in and switched to a Mac (a shiny 12&amp;rdquo; MacBook) around the FreeBSD 5 days (that would have been the mid 2000s)
From really enjoying shiny GUI tools and working Wifi without patching my kernel, did I mention suspend/resume?</description>
