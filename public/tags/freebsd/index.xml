      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first FreeBSD version was 2.2.8, for context, that was in the late 90s. I
started running FreeBSD on my desktops back then, and even managed to get it
onto a few laptops. I also build servers and firewalls and I loved the OS but
eventually caved in and switched to a Mac (a shiny 12&amp;rdquo; MacBook) around the
FreeBSD 5 days (that would have been the mid 2000s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From really enjoying shiny GUI tools and working Wifi without patching my
kernel, did I mention suspend/resume?, I started treating my Mac more and more
like a traditional Unix machine. I went back to mutt, I never stopped using vim
and more recently even switched my IM setup over to mcabber. I work inside tmux
about 80% of my day and find it so much more productive than the shiny GUIs.
I still love a graphical browser and a few tools like zoom that are a backbone
of my remote work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I went from seeing the Mac scene from lacking basic tools to
having MacPorts and fink to getting a really good and current package manager
with homebrew. I saw MacOS from being a fast, pretty UI that lacked a few
things like multiple desktops to becoming pretty full featured but also less
and less transparent. It went from being a nice OS that has enough FreeBSD
under the hood to feel a bit like home but shiny to being shiny without any
sense of feeling at home. It is a dull tool I have to use very day, no more
love, no more passion, just a tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My laptop is up for renewal and I was hoping for nice new Mac hardware that has
enough power to run a full screen FreeBSD VM in a proper hypervisor and give me
good hardware with an OS I feel at home in plus an easy migration path. I tried
veertu, Parallels and VirtualBox and decided to not wait for the absurdly
secretive timeline of new hardware releases from Apple. I decided to go back to
hacking drivers if I have to and to live with broken suspend/resume. I bought a
boring Lenovo laptop and will report over the coming weeks about my adventures
home in FreeBSD land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till my new laptop gets shipped I will continue to click through the error
reports Parallels throws at me and continue to discover what FreeBSD has done
over the past 10 years and love what I am seeing so far. It&amp;rsquo;s been a
long time but it is good to be home again.&lt;/p&gt;
