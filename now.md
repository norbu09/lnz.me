This is a page that lists my current priorities and projects. The order
is somewhat significant but not a strict rule. 

*Last update: 2015-10-22T09:54:52*

Areas of activity
-----------------

1. iwantmyname is a big focus for me at the moment
2. get some balance from working on a computer, currently:
    - building furniture for our house
3. learn and teach, currently:
    - startup weekends and working with early stage teams
    - meet interesting people and friends face to face
4. outdoorsy things, currently:
    - hiking, exploring the southern alps
    - kayaking, 
    - snowboarding season is over :(

Physical locations
------------------

I am in Wellington at least every other week for a day or two. Many of
these days are packed with meetings and spending time with my teams
here. If I don't get in touch or push your coffee meeting out another
month, this is why. Focus: 1, 3

I am in Nelson roughly once a week, normally based at the Bridge Street
Collective. I normally have time for one or two coffee meetings there.
Focus: 1, 3

The rest of the time I hide in the southern alps and focus on 1, 2 and
4
