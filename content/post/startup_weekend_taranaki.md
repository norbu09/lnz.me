Last weekend I co-facilitated [Startup Weekend
Taranaki](http://startuptaranaki.nz) with [Pascale](http://twitter.com/phpnz),
a team that in my view works very well: two funny accents, two funny last
names, two very different backgrounds so we cover a large amount of ground to
help deliver a relevant event.

Over the years both of us have been deeply involved in other experimental
events, like [Mashup](http://mashup.nz) and
[startup.school.nz](http://startup.school.nz) where we explore ways of introducing
entrepreneurship in other ways than the Startup Weekend format. Learning from
these events and with the combined background of over 30 Startup Weekends we
constantly push the format to become more relevant for the respective audience.
The weekends are very intense and once everyone is out the building on the
Sunday night we sit together and do an quick analysis on how the weekend went,
what needs work next time, what went well and so on. On Monday Pascale and I
had breakfast in New Plymouth and wrote down all the things we want to tweak
next time. 

One of the new things that went very well this time was the Lean Canvas session
we did on Saturday morning. We quickly crowd sourced the business model
for a taxi company, then pulled out a bunch of properties of that business - like
price point, target demographic, target region and so on - and then did the
same exercise with Ueber as a business model that focusses on a global market
in the same segment. This worked very well and all teams understood the use of
the canvas and made way better use of it compared to other Startup Weekends we
have been at. Introducing the Value Proposition canvas at Saturday lunch time
helped but was too late, next time we will try to introduce that on Friday
night as a pre-exercise to the Lean Canvas. 

Another addition we will make is the team building aspect. We have a few ideas
on how to gel the teams on Friday night better to make sure we avoid people
dropping off, wandering between teams of feeling lost in a team over the
weekend. We also have a few ideas around ongoing team protocols so that we
strengthen that aspect a bit more. Teams already learn a lot about team work
but it would be nice it they could leave Startup Weekend with one or two tools
that will help them in any new team in the future. The exact tools for this
are still discussed but if anyone has good experience with one I'd love to hear
about it.

Major achievement this weekend from my point of view was that all teams
understood the Canvas. No teams starting over after Friday with new ideas that
would have invalidated all work done leading up to that point. Teams that
pivoted after Friday night were iterating over business models or customer
segments rather than abandoning the idea. As a result we had less of the
obvious business models and more interesting ones. Explaining the Canvas as a
tool to quickly explore a business model and then start validating it paid off
in my view.

The thing that makes me come back to Startup Weekend is this tweaking of the
formula, this working on the format to make it relevant for the audience in the
room. Trying out new tools to help the teams get the most out of the weekend
and making sure everyone has a good time even if things are hard going every now
and then.
