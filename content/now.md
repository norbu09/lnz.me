This is a page that lists my current priorities and projects. The order
is somewhat significant but not a strict rule. 

*Last update: 2020-04-03


areas of activity
-----------------

We currently live on our sailboat and experiment with small scale living and
off-grid systems. The plan is to have a fully self sustaining pod that can roam
the world and serve us as a platofrm for living and as a place to work from.
Details on that experiment are up on https://kittyfromouter.space

physical locations
------------------

Currentl location is La Rochelle, France where we finish up the refit of our
boat. Once travel restrictions lift a bit we will be roaming around Europe
before sailing towards New Zealand.
