I have helped build and contribute to the NZ startup community since around 2008
and during that time have been granted access to many groups, back channels, side
channels, communication channels that I signed up to or got signed up to and it
continues, every new group that forms starts creating yet another mailing
list and slack channel and Facebook group.

Over the years we have created this monster that looks very open and
approachable from the inside but gives no clues on how to join it from the
outside. I have been asked so many times about how one becomes a part of this
startup community and my answer was always: "Just sign up here and there, I'll
invite you into this channel and sign you up to that" till I realised, this
massive ivory tower we built is everything but approachable. We claim to be open
when in reality we are open to those in the know.

There are many voices out there that say that people who are keen to participate
will find the right channel for them and while this is true for some I see many
that are turned off by it and don't build the companies they want to build or
don't get the advice that would help them to be more successful. It is a bit like
in the (hopefully) older days where we claimed that we (as in white male geeks)
can create a diverse scene by inviting a few women along to our meetups.

I have set up [www.nzstartup.community](http://www.nzstartup.community) as a public
forum that everyone can read without the need to sign up, where everyone can
post news, interesting articles, events and anything they want to tell the
community. It is a public place that is inclusive and approachable and even
though it is yet another thing we add to the many channels we have I hope it to
be a place where people can find information even though they are not yet invited
into the elitist circles we have built over the years.

The forum is still in its very early stages but please make use of it, please
let me know if you want to help out either as a sponsor or by helping to
administrate the forum. We want this to be a highly transparent place so we also
release all sponsorship information publicly, to follow along, check out this
thread: http://www.nzstartup.community/t/financial-transparency/38

Please use this place, fill it with life and love and start creating the open
door we want for our awesome community.
