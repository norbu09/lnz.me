There are two Startup Weekends coming up in Hawkes Bay and Taurange.
Startup Weekends are a perfect opportunity to learn how to transform an
idea to a MVP, a minimal viable product. Startup Weekends are a crash
course in entrepreneurschip over a weekend in a sheltered environment
and with near to no financial implications. The costs, in fact, are
often not even covering the food and drinks provided during the weekend.

The upcoming startup weekends in the [Hawkes Bay] and [Tauranga] are on
the weekend of the 28th of June and following weekend of the 5th of July
respectively. Make sure you show up at one of them if you are in the
region and plan to push your idea to the next stage. We have world class
mentors at both events and we will definitely have a lot of fun and
learn a lot over these two weekends.
