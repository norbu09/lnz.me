title: The chilling effect of tech law

---

Two years ago I was part of a bunch of people who put in a submission on
the Telecommunications (Interception Capability and Security) Bill. [Dave
wrote about it here: http://dave.moskovitz.co.nz/2013/08/13/tics-bill-submission/](http://dave.moskovitz.co.nz/2013/08/13/tics-bill-submission/).

Juha Saarinen posted this article on the Herald and it is really not
helping to turn around and say "we told you so", what we actually need
is politicians to get off their arrogant attitude and actually listen to
the tech community. We are a nice bunch and totally approachable but if
we get pissed off too much we'll just move our companies into countries
that have more predictable laws and politicians that are less
ill informed than ours. And know what? there may even be a significant
tax advantage in doing so.

We can, however, keep turning a blind eye on the increasingly warm
summers that dry out our country and hope that dairy is the future.
