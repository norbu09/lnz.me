Leadership is a tricky thing and over the years I have tried different
styles and was exposed to different styles. I have observed many every
successful people and people in high positions that lead big companies.

I found that most leaders fall into two categories. Leader by example
and leader by position. What I mean with that is people that live and
breath what they demand from their team, people that are respected for
what they know and people that don't have to hide behind a title to be
accepted. Those leaders were generally accepted in the team they worked
and were normally not questioned or challenged by their peers.

Leading by position is a style often found in larger companies where
politics is enough to get a position and actual execution is more in the
way than a contributing factor. If the goal is lots of money then this
leading style can be highly efficient. If the goal is a functioning team
and a good work environment then this leading style is toxic. It does
not create a level of trust and you often end up with the typical management
style where _resources_ get allocated to tasks and leaders spend most of
their time in meetings discussing important things that the team then
has to _execute_ on.

If you want to lead by example you are part of and not on top of a team.
Leading by example means that you surround yourself with peers not with
underlings that do your work. I have seen many very successful people
that did exactly that, being part of a team and leading from within not
from the top.
