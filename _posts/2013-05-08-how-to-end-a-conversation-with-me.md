description: how to end a conversation with me
---

I get quite a few people that ask me for advice on technical co-founders
or how to find a technical person for their startup. The one sentence
that ends a conversation with me needing to urgently attend another
meeting or some other way of getting away in a polite way is the
following:

"I know how to do idea X; I only need a technical person to build it
for me."

This is doomed for failure on many levels and my time is wasted trying
to point out why. If you find yourself in this situation then here are
some things to think about.

If you want to train for a marathon and never wore running shoes before
you can pay a personal trainer to get you fit but paying him to run for
you will not prepare you for the marathon, never mind how good that PT
is. Building a startup is way more challenging than running a marathon
and thinking that hiring a tech guy to "just build it" is like blaming
the PT for your missing training. If you are not looking for a partner,
for someone to work with and develop something then you are missing the
point of building something.

The next misconception is that you think you know everything and all
that is missing is the tech. If your attitude from the get go is that
you already know everything then why bother doing it, you will not learn
anything. You will waste a whole lot of time and energy realising that you did
not know everything and that is a very frustrating realisation that will
never lead you to a successful startup. It will make you bitter and give
you the idea that building startups is a horrible thing to do.

The next thing that will make you very unhappy is the fact that you
"only need a tech guy". Looking for "only a tech guy" implies that you
know how to manage a tech guy. Look for a co-founder, look for someone
you can trust on a personal level and build the business with that
person. It is critical that the product vision and the technical vision
are well aligned. Even in teams that know each other very well the
product and tech teams will always challenge each other.

Understand that your idea is only as good as the team that helps you get
there. If you think of them as underlings you will have a hard time
getting them aligned and turnover will be high. If you manage to get a
team together that is passionate about your idea, your turnover will be
low and everyone will give the best to make this idea a success.

If I referred you here, you'll know that the meeting I ran away to was
fake and I hope you learned why I did it.
