I care about entrepreneurship because I believe in the power of
collaboration and the power of people working together for fun and
profit, quite literally. I see entrepreneurship as a way to create
resilient communities that address problems by working together, by
building companies, by creating work for others and by investing back
into the community. Entrepreneurs are people that have a vision and are
crazy enough to follow that vision, passionate enough to infect others
with their idea and make them form a team around a common interest.
Entrepreneurs are people who create and are never satisfied with the
status quo. People that start sentences with "I can" not with "Someone
should" and this makes them the engines of innovation. They turn ideas
into teams into companies. Innovation only happens if someone steps up
and runs with a new idea and has enough passion to turn that idea
into a viable business. Profit can have any form or colour, some are
after the money but most entrepreneurs I have met are after the rewards
that come with building companies. The reward of creating jobs for
people, the reward of creating opportunities for people, the reward of
seeing a crazy idea grow into a viable business. All this is why I spend
many weekends every year at Startup Weekends, this is why I have coffees
with people who want advice. Growing the entrepreneurial fabric is
something I am very passionate about. 

I believe that a high level of entrepreneurship creates resilient
communities way beyond influential people, companies or politicians. I
care about the world I live in and want to play my part in creating a
future worth living for. Join me in encouraging more people to give it a
go, to try to take their future and the future of their community into
their own hands. Join me in building resilient communities. There are
plenty of activities happening, ping me if you struggle to find them and
I'll hook you up with your local community leaders or help you become
that person.
