This is a page that lists my current priorities and projects. The order
is somewhat significant but not a strict rule.

Physical locations
------------------

I am in Nelson every Thursday, based at the [Bridge Street
Collective](http://www.bridgestreet.co.nz/). I normally have time for
one or two coffee meetings there. Focus: 5, 3

I am in Wellington at least every other week for a day or two. Many of
these days are packed with meetings and spending time with my teams
here. If I don't get in touch or push your coffee meeting out another
month, this is why. Focus: 1, 3

The rest of the time I hide in the southern alps and focus on 1, 2, 4 and
5
