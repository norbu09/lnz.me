      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I was part of a bunch of people who put in a submission on
the Telecommunications (Interception Capability and Security) Bill. &lt;a href=&#34;http://dave.moskovitz.co.nz/2013/08/13/tics-bill-submission/&#34;&gt;Dave
wrote about it here: http://dave.moskovitz.co.nz/2013/08/13/tics-bill-submission/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juha Saarinen posted this article on the Herald and it is really not
helping to turn around and say &amp;ldquo;we told you so&amp;rdquo;, what we actually need
is politicians to get off their arrogant attitude and actually listen to
the tech community. We are a nice bunch and totally approachable but if
we get pissed off too much we&amp;rsquo;ll just move our companies into countries
that have more predictable laws and politicians that are less
ill informed than ours. And know what? there may even be a significant
tax advantage in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can, however, keep turning a blind eye on the increasingly warm
summers that dry out our country and hope that dairy is the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;amp;objectid=11409067&#34;&gt;Read the post on the NZ Herald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
