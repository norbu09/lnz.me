    &lt;p&gt;I attended a 4 hour work week meetup in Berlin yesterday and noticed one big
difference between me and many that were there. Tim Ferris, the author or 4
hour work week, starts from the point of view that work is something that is
not fun and in order to “live” you need to work as little as possible so you
can enjoy your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is where I would argue that I haven’t worked in a long time as
everything I do are things I actually enjoy doing. Even the things I
don’t like as a task I tend to see as things that get me closer to the
things I like and so they don’t seem to bother me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living a happy life to me is not sitting at a beach all day, I get bored
after a few hours and really want to get something done after that. I really
enjoy times where I just hang out with people and talk but even that is
time where I learn, where I do something I like that ultimately adds
to my personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four hours of work a week seems way too much or too little to me, I
really prefer doing stuff I like without any time restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Since a while we live in Berlin for a change. It is really interesting
to see how much New Zealand changed me and to see how different things
look to me now, that I have distance to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing to me is that there is this interesting split
between expats that are here to enjoy living in the startup capital of
Europe and the Germans that always find something that is bothering
them, something they can complain about, something that someone needs to
change. The observation for me is that Germans in Germany are happy to
make some else responsible for their current situation whereas those who
come here just try to get stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be a bigger thought and because of the comparably young age of
New Zealand most Kiwis needed to get stuff done, complaining did not get
you anywhere. Obviously there are awesome people here in Germany that
get stuff done, don’t blame any higher instance for their current
situation and there are Kiwis that complain bitterly about things, it is
more the general mood, the general way of how the majority thinks and
represents itself to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, summer is awesome and there are plenty of positive people around me,
just most of them speak English … like me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;ssh-tunnel-script2&quot;&gt;SSH tunnel script(2)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work quite a bit with daemons on remote hosts that are normally not
directly listening to the public internet. I use SSH tunnels a lot and
had &lt;a href=&quot;http://norbu09.org/2009/08/04/simple-ssh-tunnel-script.html&quot;&gt;previously used a simplistic script&lt;/a&gt; to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got tired of having to reconnect SSH tunnels when I changed
environments and wanted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/&quot;&gt;autossh&lt;/a&gt; to handle the connections. I hacked
around a bit with a shell script and then came up with his perl version.
The config file is a standard git like config that is quite handy as it
handles groups of servers syntax wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calls to &lt;code&gt;tunnel&lt;/code&gt; take a tunnel definition from the config file and
start the tunnel with the defined user. It is really written for a safe
environment and not nailed down for security in the moment but feel free
to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The config file can deal with inheritance and checks the standard directories
(/etc, ~/ and .) and looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[backend &quot;rabbitmq&quot;]
    local  = 5672
    remote = 5672
    host   = RABBIT_HOST
    user   = USER_WITH_SSH_KEYS

[backend &quot;couchdb&quot;]
    local  = 5986
    remote = 5984
    host   = COUCHDB_HOST
    user   = USER_WITH_SSH_KEYS

[frontend &quot;couchdb&quot;]
    local  = 5984
    remote = 5984
    host   = OTHER_COUCHDB_HOST
    user   = USER_WITH_SSH_KEYS
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tunnel script is then called with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tunnel backend.rabbitmq
tunnel frontend.couchdb
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does some basic checking if a port is used already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script can be found in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norbu09/bin/blob/master/tunnel&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt; dump on github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;internetnzs-missed-opportunity&quot;&gt;InternetNZ’s missed opportunity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open and uncapturable is the mission of InternetNZ and the promise to
push for access to the internet for everyone. This is what we as a
incorporated society stand for and what we try to push. We, all the
members of InternetNZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday at 10:00 AM the internet saw the first ever dedicated
indigenous script going online in the form of the Maori macron
implementation in the .nz namespace. The implementation of IDNs is an
imminent step to acceptance of non English (non ASCII based) scripts on
the internet and the broader access to information in native languages.
The IDN implementation in .nz is the first IDN implementation in a
English speaking ccTLD and the first ever that was done specifically to
support indigenous people. The timing was perfect as yesterday also the
Te Reo language week started as a sign to support and in fact revive the
Maori language in NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making IDNs accepted in a society needs a lot of education and this
would have been the perfect moment to run a media campaign to 
explain what IDNs are, why they are important and what we, as a society,
do to enable the native Maori script on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel ashamed that InternetNZ’s number one topic yesterday was Telecom
and not the Maori language week. No mention of IDNs and no mention on
the website other than a small note on the side bar that links to the
press release from Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in my view &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pushing for an open and uncapturable internet,
this is a missed opportunity and a lack of understanding to say the
least. I see a big opportunity to push for true openness missed by
playing politics instead of standing for our own values. I feel ashamed
being part of this society.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;lean-prototyping-stack&quot;&gt;lean prototyping stack&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my new startup I play with a lean prototyping stack that will enable
me to prototype and evaluate ideas really fast and test on the market.
The idea is to bump out a new idea, prove it and if it works scale it
further. In order to not having to rewrite the entire app once it is
clear that the idea is worth pushing I tried to come up with a nice
stack that enables me to prototype fast and scale if I have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running against all trends I use perl (neither hip nor trendy) and the
quite new &lt;a href=&quot;http://mojolicious.org&quot;&gt;Mojolicious framework&lt;/a&gt; to do the frontend part. In
Mojolicious::Lite I can prototype a small application in no time and can
host it really simple, worst case as a CGI. Mojolicious has a very
powerful HTTP client integrated that makes programming against JSON
based HTTP APIs really straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$client-&amp;gt;get($url)-&amp;gt;success-&amp;gt;json-&amp;gt;{rows}-&amp;gt;[0]-&amp;gt;{doc}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a request to the second part of my stack: &lt;a href=&quot;http://couchdb.org&quot;&gt;CouchDB&lt;/a&gt;. CouchDB is a
much loved citizen in my tool chain and there are no big surprises that
I picked it as my storage layer. The simplicity and elegance of CouchDB
in this environment makes it even more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing a small web app I normally hit the moment where I either
want to do something asynchronous or where tasks are taking too long
to wait for. Sending mails is one of those tasks. You are normally not
interested in the outcome, if things go wrong you either tell the user
via AJAX or not at all but you don’t want to wait for it. I am used to
have some sort of backend that takes care of all that. Problem with a
small prototyping framework is that you don’t want to write a full blown
backend. &lt;a href=&quot;http://rabbitmq.com&quot;&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue. RabbitMQ has a JSON RPC interface
that mimics AMQP via a HTTP/JSON interface. This fits perfectly into the
rest of my little framework as it is the same set of protocols again and
if I need to scale I can write native AMQP daemons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaling out to may small prototypes is as easy as creating the new
CouchDB databases. Most probably there is a backend daemon for what we
need already written from an earlier project or we write a quick and
dirty script in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; language we like and process the asynchronous
messages. Frontwise the interface is simple enough and pure HTTP/JSON
requests all over. Starting the Mojolicious app is in the smallest form
one file that I can use as a CGI right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll push some libraries that I need on the way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/norbu09&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; as usual. If
it turns out to work as nice and reusable as it looks in the moment I am
happy to share more if there is interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;customer-uses-proposal-as-spec&quot;&gt;customer uses proposal as spec&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the joys of working as a contractor is quoting for projects that
possibly become a real project some when. The joys of a contractor
quoting to a larger company (at least by New Zealand standards) is that
the decision trees are so arbitrary and long that it might take ages to
get one of those projects. In the meantime you hang in limbo - not too sure if you
should take on another project or not as that bigger one could still
come. I got used to that as those bigger projects always take way longer
as initially planned and by the time they are ripe the project you take
on in the meantime is done easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time round it was different. I made a nice document lining out all
sorts of technical things I would suggest to implement and after knowing
that company for a while already I had a pretty clear idea of what they
really needed and were not able to achieve on their own for the past years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doc passed the initial meetings and all looked like this time I
would actually get a project without the need for an interim project
only to learn today that my proposal was refused and instead used as a
spec for the internal teams to implement. Never mind that I think they
are utterly incapable of doing so I am quite irritated that they  not
even considered paying anything for the work I put into the proposal
that is more like a programming howto for a key part of their new
infrastructure now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I still live in Germany I would now call my lawyer - instead I
polished &lt;a href=&quot;http://springtimesoft.com&quot;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt; and decided to not work for that client
anymore, guess it is healthier and less stressful in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;real-geeks-die-early&quot;&gt;real geeks die early&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;every once in a while i &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skorks.com/2010/02/did-your-boss-thank-you-for-coding-yourself-to-death/&quot;&gt;stumble upon an article&lt;/a&gt; from someone pointing
out the dangers we geeks live in in terms of unhealthy work hours
and our very own unhealthy mind set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a developer for profit since the late 90s and a team lead since the
early 2000s. i’ve seen a fair amount of problems and have done my
fair share of work during nights, weekends and my holidays. it was
expected as part of my work and i was immature enough to not turn it
down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when i look down the road i came from i’ve lost a very good friend due
to depressions which were mainly coming from a very unhealthy work
environment and some more not so close friends either to heart attacks
or they suffered serious burn out syndromes that changed their ability
to work entirely. only weeks ago a friend of mine died after a heart
attack and he was only my age. our industry is seriously in trouble, we
set the wrong incentives and we abuse our developers as if we were in
the industrial revolution in the late 1900s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the problem is that managers will never understand that programming is
not like building a car, you take some parts and can roughly estimate
when it is assembled. geeks invent cars (to stick with the
analogy) and inventing things is not as predictable as simply assembling
stuff. as much as we think we can judge things we are either way above
or way beyond the real time spent. as we normally love what we are doing
we take this risk and try to finish in time even if we are way off with
what we estimated. the problem with inventing is that it can always go
either way, we find that very simple solution simply like that or we
can’t see it till months after the deadline. a manager has to deliver in
time - which is bollocks, it is never so time critical anyway - but a
developer has to invent that thing and deliver in time. once you are
behind schedule there is the pressure and the coding and normally this
is when quality suffers the most and the most unhealthy time is spent.
the manager keeps pushing you but he will not stay up till 2am sitting
next to you and help you code that beast. he is the one that sits
between you and the customer and has to fight off trouble - but he is
doing that between 9am and 5pm. i am not saying that either one of the
two is doing a more valuable job (i was on either side), i only want to
stress that healthy working times are essential and neglecting social
interaction which comes from long working hours will kill you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it either kills you very directly with heart attacks or slightly less
deadly but still killing your career with burn outs and nervous
breakdowns or it kills you more indirect with depressions that can lead
to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i changed my personal rat race some years ago with killing my career and
deciding that life is more about living than piling up status symbols.
funny enough since then so many new opportunities arose that i am way
better off today than i was then. working only healthy hours is
essential for your life and social interaction is key to survive as a
developer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the slides and the video from my ignite wellington talk are finally

was part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/02/global-ignite-week-starts-mond.html&quot;&gt;global ignite week&lt;/a&gt;. my talk about “realising ideas”
was quite a success and i got a lot of positive feedback. in case you
missed it - here is it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as buzz is only available via my iPhone so far i tried to figure out
from the API docs and the mailinglist how to make it all work. i hope i
have all the right headers in place and google actually knows that this
blog belongs to my shiny &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/profiles/norbu09&quot;&gt;google profile&lt;/a&gt; and all.&lt;/p&gt;

whatever. we will see in … hours/days/weeks … who cares anyway :-)&lt;/p&gt;

the talk was about how much monitoring systems suck and how to make it

works already. the code for the project is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/norbu09/TheEye&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; - check it out

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;three-new-destination-markets-in-some-months&quot;&gt;Three new destination markets in some months&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a bit of a busy time lately as we launched three new platforms
in the last time and that brought with it a lot of challenges.
Fortunately it also pushed me to complete our migration to our new
backend which is now entirely message driven and based only on the
finest stuff one finds in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backend engine is &lt;a href=&quot;http://rabbitmq.com&quot;&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt; based and persists messages to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://couchdb.apache.org&quot;&gt;CouchDB&lt;/a&gt; if necessary. We have a simple home grown workflow engine
that enables us to easily customise and change flows like what happens
if a domain gets registered or exactly when we charge a user. I spoke
about an early version of this workflow engine last year at the erlounge
Wellington
(http://norbu09.org/2009/10/15/one-system-to-rule-them-all.html). This
backend engine is a scalable hub for tasks and the main challenge was to
make our frontend stupid simple and more or less only a wrapper for
tasks happening in the backend. We have now nearly all the logic moved
and the frontend is quite slim, holding only the e-commerce and user
profile functionality whereas all the domain specific functionality
moved out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to make our frontend not only simple but also
brandable and multi currency/language. This is the moment where you
notice that strings are everywhere and solid internal APIs pay off big
time. This challenge was a big one but we managed to master it and have
now an &lt;a href=&quot;http://iWantMyName.com&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://meinName.com&quot;&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://benikvrij.nl&quot;&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; version online selling
in USD, EUR and &lt;a href=&quot;http://iWantMyName.co.nz&quot;&gt;NZD&lt;/a&gt;. The frontend is a generic one that has many
configuration knobs that can tweak the functionality but it is still
only one code base for all projects. The template sets are separate so
each language has its own template set. The two English speaking
platforms share a template set but have different currencies - the
content however is not 100% the same on the two. All this needs lots of
config variables to check against and Template::Toolkit was a big help
here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see there went a lot of effort into designing a flexible
system that can act in different environments and still be only
one system. Most of the content is now served out of CouchDB and we
further reduced the amount of data stored in PostgreSQL as well as hard
coded texts in templates. We rewrote our shopping card from scratch and
the checkout process is really simple now as most of the heavy lifting
is now in the backend. Stuff we are working on in the moment is Session
handling and user management in CouchDB with a goal to strip out
PostgreSQL entirely (the according Catalyst::Plugins are on the way).
Don’t get me wrong, we love PostgreSQL but there is no need for it
anymore once we have the remaining things ported over to CouchDB. It
simplifies our stack and reduces our admin overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of admin overhead - we also run all setups (including local
development VMs) off a puppet setup and code/template/CouchDB rollout is
done via capistrano which turns out to work quite well with catalyst and
perl. We roll out a new frontend webserver in about half an hour 
from bare debian to running frontend with the most time being spent
waiting for puppet and no manual step other then installing puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see we have been busy, if you find bugs, report them. We know that
the performance in the DNS editor is still crap but we try to sort that
and there are some rough edges here and there but most of the platforms
should run smoothly. It was a steep learning curve once again but we
managed to create a scalable system that is extremely flexible and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… hope you like it …&lt;/p&gt;
