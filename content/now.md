This is a page that lists my current priorities and projects. The order
is somewhat significant but not a strict rule. 

*Last update: 2019-07-06


areas of activity
-----------------

my main focus is on cleaning up all the things i started in the past years. i
am in a mode of removing me from everything i have done to free me up for the
next journey.

the next journey is going to be an experiment in micro companies that i can run
by myself from anywhere. the goal is to find a way to add value with the
absoloute minimum amount of ressource impact.

physical locations
------------------

i am currently in the process of becoming truely location independent. the
latest iteration in that experiment involves a sailboat and we are moored up in
La Rochelle, France to get the boat ready for the next years of sailing and
living on a boat.
