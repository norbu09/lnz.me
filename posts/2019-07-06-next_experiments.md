I hit the end of another one of my 10 year cycles and my iterative approach to
live meant that I needed to start some new experiments. Interesting enough my
live always had those decade iterations, at 10 my parents and I moved from Germany to
Austria, at 20, I got a job in Germany and moved back again, at 30 I moved to
New Zealand with Manu and since a couple of years I noticed it is time again. I
overshot my decade and needed a new overarching experiment. I love seeing live
as a big interesting experiment. I like trying out new things, living new
mental models to gain first hand experience. I love to rely on things I have
done and tried rather than theory and that has lead me down very interesting
rabbit holes in the past.

Manu and I have arrive in New Zealand with two big backpacks in 2007, the
address of a backpackers in Auckland and a rough idea of driving around a bit
and staying in Wellington for a while. We did stay for a bit longer, found an
awesome open source scene, made many friends in no time and started building
iwantmyname with Timo and Paul.

Since 2007 we moved around the Wellington region quite a bit and finally
settled a few years ago in the Southern Alps near Nelson. I truly became a
Kiwi, I identify with New Zealand way more than with any other place but I
had asked myself that dangerous question of "where do I want to be if no
constraints apply".

Location independence is an interesting thing, with iwantmyname we built a
company that has no location policy: "work from anywhere as long as you
contribute". That was a fundamental experiment in the company but also made it
possible for Manu and me to become more creative in what that actually means.
Last year we lived in a converted Landrover and explored Europe a bit more and
enjoyed a stunning summer while writing new core infrastructure for
iwantmyname. At the end of that was the question "what next" and we came up
with the latest experiment that took us a year in prep work and is now real.

I write this from an Amel Super Maramu in La Rochelle, France. An Amel SM is an
ocean going sailboat that we bought about a week ago, it was built here in La
Rochelle and is back here for some maintenance. We will work on this boat over
the coming months to make it a floating home and experimentation station for
new ideas, new mental models that we can then live and test. Location independence
in the current iteration means we can go anywhere where we can float and it gives
us a completely new perspective. I am super excited to see what that means for
our next smaller experiments that fall out of the overarching location
independent boat living one.

Speaking about smaller experiments that fall out of overarching bigger
experiments. Manu and my New Zealand experiment is not done but we pause it for
the moment to live on the water. The biggest experiment within the overarching
NZ experiment was definitely iwantmyname. As of today we have handed over the
keys to iwantmyname to their new owners. New owners that are old friends in fact and
new owners that will look after our team, our values and our customers in a
very trusting way. It is a bit like kids leaving home, you are glad they are
all grown up and leave and you have your time and space back but you also hope they
have an incredible live and call every now and then.
