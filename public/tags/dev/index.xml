      <description>Writing software is an interesting process. It transforms abstract concepts, feature requests, vague ideas into something people can interact with. It is a modern way of making ideas real, tangible, visible and hopefully usable. This process is a strange mixture of operating within tight constraints and at the same time being highly creative.
Developers come in many flavours, just like traditional crafts men, they may have studied for many years or just picked up an editor and started mucking around in someone else&amp;rsquo;s code till they felt comfortable enough to write their own code.</description>
